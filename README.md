# KubeDesk  

Welcome to **KubeDesk**, my personal repository for managing Kubernetes in my homelab and fine-tuning my Linux workspace.  

I run a Kubernetes cluster in my home environment to experiment, learn, and optimize deployments. This repo contains my YAML definitions, configurations, and scripts that help me streamline my setup. In addition to Kubernetes, I also maintain my Linux workspace with custom configurations, scripts, and tools to improve workflow efficiency.  

### What you'll find here:
:flame: Kubernetes configurations used in my homelab cluster  
:wrench: Linux workspace tweaks for a customized terminal experience  
:rocket:  Documentation and notes to keep track of best practices  

This repository serves as both a reference for myself and a resource for others who might find my configurations useful. Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or contribute!  

Happy Coding :sunglasses:
